            <h2>Summary of the First Five Chapters</h2>
            <div id="summary-container">
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>The story is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl living in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s. Scout introduces her family: her father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer, and her brother, Jem. They live next to the Radley house, which is rumored
                    to be haunted by Boo Radley, a reclusive and mysterious figure. Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill who visits Maycomb every summer. Together, they become fascinated with Boo Radley and make up stories about him, daring each other
                    to approach the Radley house.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <p>Scout begins school and is excited to start first grade. However, her excitement quickly turns to disappointment as her teacher, Miss Caroline Fisher, reprimands her for being able to read and write. Scout realizes that school is not as
                    enjoyable as she anticipated and struggles to fit in with the rigid educational system. She also learns about the economic hardships faced by many families in Maycomb, including the Cunninghams, who pay for legal services with goods
                    rather than money.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
                <p>Scout gets into trouble at school for trying to explain Walter Cunningham's situation to Miss Caroline. Jem intervenes and invites Walter to lunch at their home. During the meal, Atticus talks to Walter with respect, highlighting the Finch
                    family's values of empathy and understanding. Scout learns from Atticus and their housekeeper, Calpurnia, the importance of treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status. Scout continues to struggle with
                    her teacher and school rules.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
                <p>As summer approaches, Scout and Jem find gifts hidden in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. These gifts include chewing gum and small carved figures. They are intrigued and suspect Boo Radley may be leaving the items for them.
                    Dill returns to Maycomb for the summer, and the children resume their fascination with Boo Radley. They play games that mimic the Radley family's life, further fueling their curiosity and imagination about Boo.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
                <p>Scout spends more time with Miss Maudie Atkinson, a kind neighbor who shares stories about the Radley family. Miss Maudie tells Scout that Boo Radley is still alive and describes him as a kind person who was likely emotionally damaged
                    by his strict, religious upbringing. Jem and Dill come up with a plan to deliver a note to Boo Radley, inviting him to come out and meet them. Their plan is interrupted by Atticus, who sternly warns them to stop bothering Boo and to
                    respect his privacy.</p>
